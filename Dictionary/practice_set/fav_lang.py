# Q(7). If name of the two friends are same, then what will happen in the program

# answer: If two friends have the same name, the second entry will overwrite the
#         first one because dictionary keys must be unique.

# Q(8). If languages of two friends are same, then what will happen in the program

# answer: If two friends have the same favorite language, nothing unusual happens because dictionary values can be duplicated.
